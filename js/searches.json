Two-thirds of the state's population lives in the New York City Metropolitan Area, and nearly 40% lives on Long Island.<ref name=NYCest2/> Both the state and New York City were named for the 17th-century [[Duke of York]], future [[James II of England|King James II of England]]. The next four most populous cities in the state are [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], while the [[List of U.S. state capitals|state capital]] is [[Albany, New York|Albany]].\n\nNew York has a diverse geography. The southern part of the state consists of Long Island and several smaller associated islands, as well as New York City and the lower [[Hudson River Valley]], most of which lie within the wider [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]]. The large region known as [[Upstate New York]] consists of several ranges of the wider [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and [[Catskills]] along New York's [[Southern Tier]], and the [[Adirondack Mountains]], [[Thousand Islands]] [[archipelago]], and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in the [[North Country (New York)|Northeastern lobe]] of the state.  These more mountainous regions are bisected by two major river valleys&mdash;the north-south Hudson River Valley and the east-west [[Mohawk River]] Valley, which forms the core of the [[Erie Canal]].  [[Western New York]] is considered part of the [[Great Lakes Region]] and straddles [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Erie]]. Between the two lakes lies [[Niagara Falls]]. The central part of the state is dominated by the [[Finger Lakes]], a popular vacation and tourist destination.\n\nNew York had been inhabited by tribes of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York. The first Europeans to arrive were [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] and [[Jesuit missionaries]] who arrived southward from settlements at [[Montreal]] for trade and proselytizing. In 1609, the region was claimed by [[Henry Hudson]] for the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], who built [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 at the confluence of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled [[New Amsterdam]] and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the colony of [[New Netherland]], a multicultural community from its earliest days and a center of trade and immigration. The [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] annexed the colony from the Dutch in 1664. The borders of the British colony, the [[Province of New York]], were similar to those of the present-day state.\n\nMany landmarks in New York are well known to both international and domestic visitors, with New York State hosting four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: [[Times Square]], [[Central Park]], Niagara Falls (shared with Ontario), and [[Grand Central Terminal]].<ref name=\"Ann Shields\">{{cite web|title=The World's 50 Most Visited Tourist Attractions \u2013 No. 3: Times Square, New York City \u2013 Annual Visitors: 50,000,000|author=Ann Shields|publisher=Travel+Lesiure|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/worlds-most-visited-tourist-attractions/5|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2015|quote=No. 3 Times Square, New York City - Annual Visitors: 50,000,000...No. 4 (tie) Central Park, New York City - Annual Visitors: 40,000,000...No. 9: Niagara Falls, New York and Ontario - Annual Visitors: 22,000,000...No. 10 Grand Central Terminal, New York City - Annual Visitors: 21,600,000}}</ref> New York is home to the [[Statue of Liberty]], a symbol of the United States and its ideals of freedom, [[democracy]], and opportunity.<ref>{{cite web| title = Statue of Liberty| work=World Heritage| publisher=UNESCO| url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/307| accessdate = July 17, 2015}}</ref> In the [[21st century]], New York has emerged as a global node of [[innovation|creativity]] and [[entrepreneurship]],<ref name=VentureCapitalNY1>{{cite web|url=http://nvca.org/research/venture-investment/|title=Venture Investment - Regional Aggregate Data|publisher=National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate=April 22, 2016}}</ref> [[social tolerance]],<ref name=SocialToleranceNY1>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/23/ted-cruz-deplores-liberal-left-wing-values-while-lobbying-for-new-york-votes/|title=Ted Cruz Deplores 'Liberal, Left-Wing Values' While Lobbying for New York Votes|author=Matt Flegenheimer|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=April 22, 2016}}</ref> and [[sustainability|environmental sustainability]].<ref name=EnvironmentalSustainabilityNY1>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/04/22/world/ap-un-united-nations-climate-agreement-the-latest.html?_r=0|title=The Latest: China Hopes US Joins Climate Deal Quickly|author=The Associated Press|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2016|accessdate=April 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name=EnvironmentalSustainabilityNY2>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/nyregion/new-york-city-climate-change-march.html|title=Taking a Call for Climate Change to the Streets|author=Lisa Foderaro|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 21, 2014|accessdate=April 22, 2016}}</ref> New York's [[List of colleges and universities in New York|higher education network]] comprises approximately 200 colleges and universities, including [[Columbia University]], [[Cornell University]], [[New York University]], and [[Rockefeller University]], which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2015.html|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2015|publisher=ShanghaiRanking Consultancy |accessdate=August 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cwur.org/2015/|title=CWUR 2015 - World University Rankings|publisher=Center for World University Rankings|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of New York}}\n\n===16th century===\nIn 1524, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], an Italian explorer in the service of the French crown, explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the Carolinas and Newfoundland, including [[New York Harbor]] and [[Narragansett Bay]]. On April 17, 1524 Verrazanno entered [[New York Bay]], by way of the strait now called [[the Narrows]] into the northern bay which he named Santa Margherita, in honor of the King of France's [[Marguerite de Navarre|sister]]. Verrazzano described it as \"a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass\" and he adds: \"that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake. This vast sheet of water swarmed with native boats\". He landed on the tip of Manhattan and possibly on the furthest point of Long Island.

The first of these trading posts were [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] (1614, near present-day [[Albany, New York|Albany]]); [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] (1624, on the [[Hudson River]] just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau), developing into settlement [[Beverwijck]] (1647), and into what became Albany; [[Fort Amsterdam]] (1625, to develop into the town [[New Amsterdam]] which is present-day New York City); and Esopus, (1653, now [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]]). The success of the [[patroon]]ship of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]] (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony. The English captured the colony during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and governed it as the [[Province of New York]]. The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch in 1673 during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] (1672\u20131674) and renamed New Orange. It was returned to the English under the terms of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] a year later.<ref>Scheltema, Gajus and Westerhuijs, Heleen (eds.),''Exploring Historic Dutch New York''.

The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in the city on October 19 of that year, composed of representatives from across the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who set the stage for the [[Continental Congress]] to follow. The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]], which was the first written expression by representatives of the Americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. This included the right to [[No taxation without representation|representative government]]. At the same time, with strong trading between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and the United States on both business and personal levels many New York residents were Loyalists. The [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] provided the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|cannon and gunpowder]] necessary to force a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] withdrawal from the [[Siege of Boston]] in 1775.\n\nNew York was the only colony to [[United States Declaration of Independence#Draft and adoption|not vote for independence]], as the delegates were not authorized to do so.

On July 30, 1777, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] was inaugurated as the first [[Governor of New York]] at Kingston.\n\nAbout one-third of the battles of the [[American Revolutionary War]] took place in New York; the first major battle after U.S. independence was declared\u2014and the largest battle of the entire war\u2014was fought in New York at the [[Battle of Long Island]] (a.k.a. ''Battle of Brooklyn'') in August 1776. After their victory, the British occupied New York City, making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the focus of General [[George Washington]]'s [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]]. On the notorious British [[HMS Jersey (1736)|prison ships]] of [[Wallabout Bay]], more American combatants died of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war, combined. Both sides of combatants lost more soldiers to disease than to outright wounds.The first of two major British armies were captured by the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Battles of Saratoga|Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, a success that influenced France to ally with the revolutionaries.The state constitution was enacted in 1777.

That organization was found to be insufficient, and prominent New Yorker [[Alexander Hamilton]] advocated a new government that would include an executive, national courts, and the power to tax. Hamilton led the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]] that called for the [[Philadelphia Convention]], which drafted the United States Constitution, in which he also took part. The new government was to be a strong [[Federation|federal]] national government to replace the relatively weaker [[confederation]] of individual states. Following heated debate, which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation\u2014[[The Federalist Papers|''The Federalist'' Papers]]\u2014as a series of installments in New York City newspapers, New York was the 11th state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on July 26, 1788.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/rat_ny.html|title=New York's Ratification |publisher=The U.S. Constitution Online |accessdate=April 10, 2008}}</ref> New York remained the national capital under the new constitution until 1790, and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington, the drafting of [[United States Bill of Rights]], and the first session of the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Hamilton's revival of the heavily indebted United States economy after the war and the creation of a national bank significantly contributed to New York City becoming the [[financial center]] of the new nation.\n\nBoth the Dutch and the British imported African slaves as laborers to the city and colony; New York had the second-highest population of slaves after Charleston, SC. Slavery was extensive in New York City and some agricultural areas. The state passed a law for the gradual abolition of slavery soon after the Revolutionary War, but the last slave in New York was not freed until 1827.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|thumb|The [[Erie Canal]] at [[Lockport, New York|Lockport]], New York in 1839]]\nTransportation in western New York was by expensive wagons on muddy roads before canals opened up the rich farm lands to long-distance traffic.  Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] promoted the Erie Canal that connected New York City to the Great Lakes, by the Hudson River, the new canal, and the rivers and lakes.

It was an engineering marvel which opened up vast areas of New York to commerce and settlement. It enabled Great Lakes port cities such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to grow and prosper. It also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes, with the port of New York City.

In the United States, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890. Prior to this time, the matter was delegated to the individual states, then via contract between the states and the federal government. Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[East River]]s, in the eventual [[Lower Manhattan]]. On May 4, 1847 the [[New York State Legislature]] created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110063703/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archivedate=November 10, 2013 |title=Castle Garden as An Immigrant Depot:1855\u20131890 |publisher=National Park Service|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in 1855 at [[Castle Clinton|Castle Garden]], a converted [[War of 1812]] era fort located within what is now [[Battery Park]], at the tip of Lower Manhattan. The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from [[quarantine]]. Castle Garden served as New York's immigrant depot until it closed on April 18, 1890 when the federal government assumed control over immigration. During that period, more than 8 million immigrants passed through its doors (two out of every three U.S. immigrants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm |title=Castle Clinton |publisher=National Park Service|date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government assumed control, it established the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Bureau of Immigration]], which chose the three-acre  Ellis Island in [[Upper New York Bay|Upper New York Harbor]] for an entry depot. Already federally controlled, the island had served as an ammunition depot. It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], via a short ferry ride. While the island was being developed and expanded via [[land reclamation]], the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery.<ref>Vincent J. Cannato: ''American Passage: The History of Ellis Island.'' p.50: Harper Collins (2009) ISBN 0060742739</ref>\n\nEllis Island opened on January 1, 1892, and operated as a central immigration center until the [[Immigration Act of 1924|National Origins Act]] was passed in 1924, reducing immigration. After that date, the only immigrants to pass through were [[displaced persons]] or war [[refugees]]. The island ceased all immigration processing on November 12, 1954 when the last person detained on the island, [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] seaman Arne Peterssen, was released. He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the 10:15&nbsp;a.m. Manhattan-bound ferry to return to his ship.\n\nMore than 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. More than 100 million Americans across the United States can trace their [[ancestry]] to these immigrants.\n\nEllis Island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between New York State and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed it. The issue was settled in 1998 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] which ruled that the original {{convert|3.3|acre|adj=on}} island was New York State territory and that the balance of the {{convert|27.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html|title=The Ellis Island Verdict: The Ruling|author=Linda Greenhouse|date=May 27, 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The island was added to the [[National Park Service]] system in May 1965 by President [[Lyndon B.

Upstate New York experiences warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions, with long and cold winters. Western New York, particularly the Tug Hill region, receives heavy [[lake-effect snow]]s, especially during the earlier portions of winter, before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice.

In 2007, the state exported a total of $71.1 billion worth of goods, with the five largest foreign export markets being [[Canada]] (US$15 billion), the [[United Kingdom]] (US$6 billion), [[Switzerland]] (US$5.9 billion), [[Israel]] (US$4.9 billion), and [[Hong Kong]] (US$3.4 billion). New York's largest imports are oil, gold, aluminum, natural gas, electricity, rough diamonds, and lumber. The state also has a large [[manufacturing sector]] that includes printing and the production of [[garment]]s, mainly in New York City; and furs, railroad equipment, automobile parts, and bus line vehicles, concentrated in Upstate regions.\n\nNew York is the nation's third-largest [[grape]] producing state, and second-largest [[wine]] producer by volume, behind California. The southern [[Finger Lakes]] hillsides, the Hudson Valley, the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] of Long Island, and the southern shore of Lake Erie are the primary grape- and wine-growing regions in New York, with many [[vineyard]]s. In 2012, New York had 320 [[wineries]] and 37,000 grape bearing acres, generating full-time employment of nearly 25,000 and annual wages of over US$1.1 billion, and yielding US$4.8 billion in direct economic impact from New York grapes, grape juice, and wine and grape products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkwines.org/Pages/FactsAndFigures|title=Welcome to New York Wine Country!|publisher=New York Wine & Grape Foundation|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nNew York is a major agricultural producer overall, ranking among the top five states for agricultural products including [[maple syrup]], apples, cherries, [[cabbage]], dairy products, onions, and potatoes. The state is the largest producer of cabbage in the U.S. The state has about a quarter of its land in farms and produced $3.4 billion in agricultural products in 2001. The south shore of Lake Ontario provides the right mix of [[soil]]s and [[microclimate]] for many apple, cherry, [[plum]], pear and [[peach]] [[orchard]]s. Apples are also grown in the Hudson Valley and near Lake Champlain. A moderately sized saltwater [[commercial fishing|commercial fishery]] is located along the Atlantic side of Long Island. The principal catches by value are clams, lobsters, squid, and flounder.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main article|Education in New York (state)}}\n[[File:New York State of Education building daytime, 2012.jpg|thumb|The [[New York State Education Department Building]], Albany]]\nThe [[University of the State of New York]] accredits and sets standards for primary, middle-level, and secondary education in the state, while the [[New York State Education Department]] oversees public schools and  controls their [[standardized test]]s. The [[New York City Department of Education]] manages the [[New York City Public Schools]] system. In 1894, reflecting general racial discrimination then, the state passed a law that allowed communities to set up separate schools for children of African-American descent. In 1900, the state passed another law requiring integrated schools.<ref>Martha A. Sandweiss, ''Passing Strange: A Gilded Age Tale of Love and Deception Across the Color Line'', New York: Penguin Press, 2009, p. 213</ref>\n\nAt the level of [[higher education in the United States|post-secondary education]], the statewide public university system is the [[State University of New York]], commonly referred to as SUNY. New York City also has its own [[City University of New York]] system, which is funded by the city. The SUNY system consists of 64 community colleges, technical colleges, undergraduate colleges, and doctoral-granting institutions, including several universities. New York's largest public university is the [[State University of New York at Buffalo]], which was founded by U.S President and Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suny.edu/student/campuses_complete_list.cfm |title=SUNY Buffalo: Complete Campus List |publisher=Suny.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/ubhistory/presidents.html|title=Chancellors and Presidents of the University|accessdate=2016-06-20|publisher=University of Buffalo, The State University of New York}}</ref> The four SUNY University Centers, offering a wide array of academic programs, are the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]], [[Binghamton University]], [[Stony Brook University]], and the University at Buffalo.\n\nNotable large private universities include the [[Columbia University]] in [[Upper Manhattan]] and [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], both [[Ivy League]] institutions, as well as [[New York University]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], and [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx, Manhattan, and [[Westchester County]]. Smaller notable private institutions of higher education include [[Rockefeller University]], [[New York Institute of Technology]], [[Yeshiva University]], and [[Hofstra University]]. There are also a multitude of [[postgraduate degree|postgraduate]]-level schools in New York State, including [[Medical School|Medical]], [[Law School|Law]], and [[Engineering]] schools. [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], the service academy of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], is located just south of [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], on the west bank of the Hudson River.\n\nDuring the fiscal 2013 year, New York spent more on public education per pupil than any other state, according to [[U.S. Census Bureau]] statistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html|title=Education Spending Per Student by State|publisher=Governing|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Main article|Transportation in New York}}\n[[File:TappanZeeBridgeFromBelow.JPG|thumb|The [[Tappan Zee Bridge]], linking [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties, is the second-longest bridge in the [[northeastern United States]].]]\n[[File:JFK Plane Queue.jpg|thumb|left|[[John F.

Engineering challenges posed by the complex terrain of the state and the unique infrastructural issues of New York City brought on by urban crowding have had to be overcome perennially. Population expansion of the state has followed the path of the early waterways, first the [[Hudson River]] and [[Mohawk River]], then the [[Erie Canal]]. In the 19th century, railroads were constructed along the river valleys, followed by the [[New York State Thruway]] in the 20th century.\n\nThe [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT) is the department of the [[government of New York (state)|government of New York]]<ref>[[Transportation Law]] \u00a7 11. \"There shall be in the state government a department of transportation.

The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (PANYNJ) is a joint venture between the States of New York and New Jersey and authorized by the [[US Congress]], established in 1921 through an [[interstate compact]], that oversees much of the regional transportation infrastructure, including [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[seaport]]s, within the geographical jurisdiction of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]].

Other cities and towns in New York have urban and regional public transportation. In Buffalo, the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] runs the [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] light-rail system; in Rochester, the [[Rochester Subway]] operated from 1927 until 1956, but fell into disuse as state and federal investment went to highways.\n\nThe [[New York State Department of Motor Vehicles]] (NYSDMV or DMV) is the governmental agency responsible for registering and [[vehicle inspection|inspecting automobiles]] and other motor vehicles, as well as licensing drivers in the State of New York. {{As of|2008}}, the NYSDMV has 11,284,546 drivers licenses on file<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/statli08.htm |title=NYS DMV \u2013 Statistics \u2013 NYS Driver Licenses on File \u2013 2008 |publisher=New York State Department of Motor Vehicles |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011011532/http://www.dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/statli08.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> and 10,697,644 vehicle registrations in force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/regin08.htm |title=NYS DMV \u2013 Statistics \u2013 Vehicle Registrations in Force \u2013 2008 |publisher=New York State Department of Motor Vehicles |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011011840/http://www.dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/regin08.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> All gasoline-powered vehicles registered in New York State are required to have an [[emission standard|emissions inspection]] every 12 months, in order to ensure that [[environmental quality]] controls are working to prevent air pollution. Diesel-powered vehicles with a gross weight rating over 8,500&nbsp;lb that are registered in most Downstate New York counties must get an annual emissions inspection. All vehicles registered in New York State must get an annual safety inspection.\n\nPortions of the transportation system are [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]], allowing travelers to switch easily from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is [[AirTrain JFK]] which allows rail passengers to travel directly to [[airport terminal|terminals]] at [[John F.

It is composed of three branches: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]].\n\nThe [[Governor of New York|Governor]] is the State's chief executive and is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|Lieutenant Governor]]. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the [[New York Attorney General|Attorney General]], and the [[New York State Comptroller|Comptroller]]. The [[Secretary of State of New York|Secretary of State]], formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the Governor.\n\nThe [[New York State Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] and consists of the [[New York State Senate]] and the [[New York State Assembly]]. The Assembly consists of 150 members, while the Senate varies in its number of members, currently having 63. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to [[veto]] a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in favor of overriding in each House. The permanent laws of a general nature are [[codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Consolidated Laws of New York]]''.\n\nThe highest court of appeal in the [[Judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]] is the [[New York State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] whereas the primary [[felony]] [[trial court]] is the [[New York County Court|County Court]] (or the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including [[small claims]], traffic ticket cases, and local [[zoning]] matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The [[New York City courts]] make up the largest local court system.\n\nThe [[administrative divisions of New York|state is divided]] into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are [[municipal corporation]]s with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and [[New York state public-benefit corporations]], frequently known as ''authorities'' or ''development corporations''. Each municipal corporation is granted varying [[home rule]] powers as provided by the New York Constitution. The state also has 10 [[Indian reservation]]s.\n\n====Capital punishment====\n{{Main article|Capital punishment in New York}}\n[[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] was reintroduced in 1995 under the [[George Pataki#Death penalty|Pataki administration]], but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v.

New York City, as well as the state's other major urban locales, including Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse, are significant Democratic strongholds, with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal politics]]. Rural portions of upstate New York, however, are generally more conservative than the cities and tend to favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Heavily populated suburban areas downstate, such as Westchester County and Long Island, have swung between the major parties since the 1980s, but more often than not support Democrats.\n\nNew York City is the most important source of [[political fundraising]] in the United States for both major parties.
